Experience working on Linux-based infrastructure
 real time sceanrio based questions for experiencd devops engineer
trouble shoot commands with explaination 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some real-time scenario-based questions for experienced DevOps engineers focusing on troubleshooting commands and their explanations in a Linux-based infrastructure:

Scenario: High CPU Utilization on a Linux Server:

Question: "You receive alerts indicating high CPU utilization on one of your Linux servers. How would you troubleshoot this issue?"
Troubleshooting Commands and Explanation:
top: This command provides real-time information about CPU usage, processes, and memory utilization. By running top, you can identify which processes are consuming the most CPU resources.
ps: Use this command to list running processes and their resource utilization. You can filter processes based on CPU usage to identify any runaway processes causing high CPU utilization.
htop: Similar to top, htop provides an interactive process viewer with more detailed information and options for sorting and filtering processes.
sar: The System Activity Reporter (SAR) command collects and reports system performance metrics, including CPU usage, over time. Running sar with appropriate options can help identify trends and patterns in CPU utilization.
Scenario: Disk Space Exhaustion on a Linux Server:

Question: "A critical application fails to start due to insufficient disk space on a Linux server. How would you troubleshoot and free up disk space?"
Troubleshooting Commands and Explanation:
df -h: This command displays disk space usage on mounted filesystems in a human-readable format. Use df -h to identify which filesystems are running out of space and require attention.
du -h --max-depth=1 /: Use this command to analyze disk usage in the root directory (/). By specifying --max-depth=1, you limit the depth of the directory tree to the immediate subdirectories, making it easier to identify space-consuming directories.
find /var/log -type f -size +100M: This command finds files larger than 100MB in the /var/log directory, which often contains log files that can grow unexpectedly and consume disk space. You can then review and rotate or delete large log files to free up space.
lsof | grep deleted: Running lsof (list open files) with grep deleted can help identify deleted but still open files that might be consuming disk space. This can occur when a process holds onto deleted files, preventing them from being truly freed until the process is restarted or terminated.
Scenario: Network Connectivity Issues on a Linux Server:

Question: "Users report intermittent connectivity issues with a Linux server hosting a web application. How would you troubleshoot network connectivity problems?"
Troubleshooting Commands and Explanation:
ping: Use the ping command to test network connectivity to another host by sending ICMP echo requests and waiting for responses. This helps determine if the server can reach other hosts on the network and vice versa.
traceroute: Running traceroute helps identify the network path and any hops between the server and a destination host. This can pinpoint where connectivity issues or delays occur along the route.
netstat -tuln: This command displays listening ports (-l) and established connections (-t) on the server. Use netstat to check if the required network services are running and accessible on the expected ports.
ifconfig or ip addr: These commands display network interface configuration information, including IP addresses, netmasks, and interface status. Use them to verify network interface settings and check for errors or dropped packets.
Scenario: Application Performance Degradation on a Linux Server:

Question: "Users complain about slow response times from a critical application hosted on a Linux server. How would you troubleshoot performance issues?"
Troubleshooting Commands and Explanation:
vmstat 1: Running vmstat with a refresh interval of 1 second (1) provides real-time system performance metrics, including CPU, memory, disk, and swap usage. Use vmstat to identify resource bottlenecks and potential performance issues.
iostat -x: The iostat command reports disk I/O statistics, including utilization, throughput, and response times. Running iostat -x helps identify disk I/O bottlenecks and determine if slow disk performance is impacting application performance.
free -m: This command displays memory usage statistics, including total memory, free memory, and memory used by buffers and caches. Use free -m to check if the server is experiencing memory shortages that could
Scenario: SSH Connection Failure to a Linux Server:

Question: "You are unable to establish an SSH connection to a Linux server. How would you troubleshoot this issue?"
Troubleshooting Commands and Explanation:
ssh -vvv user@hostname: Running SSH with increased verbosity (-vvv) provides detailed debugging information, including the SSH negotiation process, key exchange, and authentication attempts. Use this command to diagnose SSH connection failures and identify potential issues such as network connectivity problems or authentication errors.
sshd -T: This command displays the SSH server's configuration settings, including options specified in the SSH daemon configuration file (sshd_config). Use sshd -T to verify SSH server settings, such as allowed authentication methods, port number, and access control rules.
journalctl -u sshd: On systems using systemd, journalctl retrieves and displays logs from the system journal. Use journalctl -u sshd to view SSH server logs and identify any error messages or events related to SSH connections.
iptables -L: If the server has a firewall configured using iptables, use iptables -L to list firewall rules and check if SSH traffic is allowed through the firewall. Ensure that the appropriate firewall rules permit SSH connections on the configured port (default: 22).
These scenario-based questions and troubleshooting commands are designed to assess your ability to diagnose and resolve common issues encountered in Linux-based infrastructure environments. Be prepared to explain your troubleshooting approach, interpret command output, and take appropriate actions to resolve the issues effectively.
